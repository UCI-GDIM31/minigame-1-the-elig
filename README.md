## Devlog  
Prompt: Write a metaphor for how you would describe the relationship between Components, GameObjects, 
and Scenes to another student. In the first in-class activity, we described Components
as being the “building blocks” of GameObjects, and GameObjects as the “building blocks” 
of Scenes; come up with your own creative way to visualize and describe this relationship 
without using the phrase “building blocks”.  


In Unity, Components, GameObjects, and Scenes act as nesting dolls, wherein Components are 
a smaller subgroup inside of GameObjects, and GameObjects are a smaller subset of Scenes. They
make each other up.
